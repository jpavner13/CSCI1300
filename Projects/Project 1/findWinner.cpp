    calculate likenessScore for each players sequences
    check to see if all scores are 0
    if they are, return that there are no winners
    compare each score to see if there is one overall winner
    if there is, return that winner
    if not, compare to see if there are two winners
    if there is, return which two players won
    if not, compare to see if there are three winners
    if there are, congradualate all players
