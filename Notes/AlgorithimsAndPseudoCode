Algorithams: A set of instructions
- recippe for cooking:
    - inputs: ingredients
    - Sequential Steps
    - Outputs: serving size and style
    - Computer is the chef: Be descriptive to the chef (Douesnt understad "A bunch of flour")

- Abstraction: Reusing code to simplify it 

Software development Process:
    1- understand the problem
    2- develop and describe an algoritham 
    3- test the algoritham with simple inputs
    4- Translate algoritham into C++
    5- Compile and test the program

Variables: Values or quanities that change over time (Numbers, text, etc.)

Pseudo Code: A notation resembling a simplified programming language for describing algorithams
    (Is language universal, can be made in any language)
